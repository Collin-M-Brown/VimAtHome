issues with folding:
-jump
-most subjects auto open fold really annoying

maybe new quick menu: open commands
goto finder/git/etc
toggle copilot

snapshot location for viewing
remove moving at end/beginning of line moving to next line above/below

calculator

add highlight to anchors again
history
pull from insert mode
when deleting in extend, it keeps a residual selection

move del shift to pull

Fast.. Add selection to custom finder. add to goto menu
fast.. find next in custom finder maybe replace find next match if it exists?

//////

track all instances of last command used.
add a repeat last command key

//////

shift+o should be jump to block
need move to next non empty non-word line below/above would be nice, i can replace the move to next match maybe

/////

when pullng ,
gets stuck in layer 0
can't move because layer 0 but still in command mode, so pull needs to either exit command mode or make sure keyboard is in move mode
best to just restore the previous mode

when move to empty space, check above and below indentation and modify current line to match

/////

for bracketize
- check if line above is not empty
    - if so, assume its the if statement,
    - make sure selected lines are 1 indentation greater than parent line
        - means don't indent if already indented, lower indent if too much, increase indent if too little
    - add bracket to the end of the parent line
    
for selection highlight
- reselecting should remove
