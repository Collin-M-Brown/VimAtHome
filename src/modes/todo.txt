issues with folding:
-jump
-most subjects auto open fold really annoying

maybe new quick menu: open commands
goto finder/git/etc
toggle copilot

snapshot location for viewing
remove moving at end/beginning of line moving to next line above/below

calculator

add highlight to anchors again
history
pull from insert mode
when deleting in extend, it keeps a residual selection

move del shift to pull

Fast.. Add selection to custom finder. add to goto menu
fast.. find next in custom finder maybe replace find next match if it exists?

//////

track all instances of last command used.
add a repeat last command key

//////

shift+o should be jump to block
need move to next non empty non-word line below/above would be nice, i can replace the move to next match maybe
